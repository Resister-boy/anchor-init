### AIShares 2025 Solana Bootcamp Submission Repository

> This repository is for submission for the 2025 Solana Bootcamp. This repository contains Solana Program code based on the Anchor Framework(Rust) and a Next.js(Typescript) based client code to interact with the above Solana Program. AIShare receives users' investment strategies to generate unique trading-specialized AI agents. These AI agents are tokenized by funding them, allowing token holders to share in the profits earned through the AI agents' trading activities. This repository includes the following features:

1. Users can enter your investment strategy to create an AI agent along with its corresponding Fund and Token.
2. Users can transfer SOL to the Fund, and once the Fund is fully funded, they can claim and receive the Token corresponding to the AI agent.
3. Users can exchange the Token back to SOL.
